# NoSQL-social-network-api

# Description
This project consists in the creation of a functional API to register users, friends, thoughts and reactions in order to facilitate the interaction process among users in a social network. I enjoyed doing this project because it helped me to strength the skills I am learning about non-relational databases and how they operate versus relational databases like MySQL. 

# Usage
In order to create this API, I applied the CRUD operations "create", "read", "update" and "delete" on users and thoughts, and the "create" and "delete" operations on friends and reactions. By doing so, users can see their friends and their friends' reactions. They can also update and delete their information and they can see the date the operation was created. This API can be very useful to keep people in close contact and have fun with it! 

# Technologies
The technologies I used in this project are MongoDB, as the NoSQL database, and the Object Data Modeling, Mongoose. I also used the back-end JavaScript runtime environment Node; the Node framework, Express; the library, Moment; and, Insomnia to test my REStul API.
